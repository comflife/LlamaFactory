The overall terrain is undulating, with the hill providing a natural backdrop to the scene.\n<trajectory>\n[0.000,0.000,0.000],[-0.019,2.019,0.000],[-0.062,4.082,0.000],[-0.100,6.103,0.000],[-0.122,8.125,0.000],[-0.123,10.146,0.000],[-0.100,12.167,0.000],[-0.070,14.200,0.000],[-0.022,16.221,0.000],[0.000,18.242,0.000],[0.027,20.263,0.000],[0.043,22.284,0.000],[0.043,24.305,0.000],[0.032,26.326,0.000],[0.000,28.347,0.000],[-0.000,30.368,0.000],[-0.000,32.389,0.000],[-0.000,34.410,0.000],[-0.000,36.431,0.000],[-0.000,38.452,0.000],[-0.000,40.473,0.000],[-0.000,42.494,0.000],[-0.000,44.515,0.000],[-0.000,46.536,0.000],[-0.000,48.557,0.000],[-0.000,50.578,0.000],[-0.000,52.599,0.000],[-0.000,54.620,0.000],[-0.000,56.641,0.000],[-0.000,58.662,0.000],[-0.000,60.683,0.000],[-0.000,62.704,0.000],[-0.000,64.725,0.000],[-0.000,66.746,0.000],[-0.000,68.767,0.000],[-0.000,70.788,0.000],[-0.000,72.809,0.000],[-0.000,74.830,0.000],[-0.000,76.851,0.000],[-0.000,78.872,0.000],[-0.000,80.893,0.000],[-0.000,82.914,0.000],[-0.000,84.935,0.000],[-0.000,86.956,0.000],[-0.000,88.977,0.000],[-0.000,91.000,0.000],[-0.000,93.021,0.000],[-0.000,95.042,0.000],[-0.000,97.063,0.000],[-", "trajectory_points": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [-0.019, 2.019, 0.0], [-0.062, 4.082, 0.0], [-0.1, 6.103, 0.0], [-0.122, 8.125, 0.0], [-0.123, 10.146, 0.0], [-0.1, 12.167, 0.0], [-0.07, 14.2, 0.0], [-0.022, 16.221, 0.0], [0.0, 18.242, 0.0], [0.027, 20.263, 0.0], [0.043, 22.284, 0.0], [0.043, 24.305, 0.0], [0.032, 26.326, 0.0], [0.0, 28.347, 0.0], [-0.0, 30.368, 0.0], [-0.0, 32.389, 0.0], [-0.0, 34.41, 0.0], [-0.0, 36.431, 0.0], [-0.0, 38.452, 0.0], [-0.0, 40.473, 0.0], [-0.0, 42.494, 0.0], [-0.0, 44.515, 0.0], [-0.0, 46.536, 0.0], [-0.0, 48.557, 0.0], [-0.0, 50.578, 0.0], [-0.0, 52.599, 0.0], [-0.0, 54.62, 0.0], [-0.0, 56.641, 0.0], [-0.0, 58.662, 0.0], [-0.0, 60.683, 0.0], [-0.0, 62.704, 0.0], [-0.0, 64.725, 0.0], [-0.0, 66.746, 0.0], [-0.0, 68.767, 0.0], [-0.0, 70.788, 0.0], [-0.0, 72.809, 0.0], [-0.0, 74.83, 0.0], [-0.0, 76.851, 0.0], [-0.0, 78.872, 0.0], [-0.0, 80.893, 0.0], [-0.0, 82.914, 0.0], [-0.0, 84.935, 0.0], [-0.0, 86.956, 0.0], [-0.0, 88.977, 0.0], [-0.0, 91.0, 0.0], [-0.0, 93.021, 0.0], [-0.0, 95.042, 0.0], [-0.0, 97.063, 0.0]], "gt_trajectory_points": null, "composite_path": "/home/byounggun/LlamaFactory/orad3d_infer_samples_orpo/004_validation_y0602_1327_1623175100258.png", "meta": {"source": "orad3d", "split": "validation", "sequence": "y0602_1327", "timestamp": "1623175100258", "system": "You are an off-road autonomous driving agent.
